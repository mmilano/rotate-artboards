# Rotate Artboard Orientation

Simple plugin for Sketch to rotate the orientation of selected artboards. 

Akin to toggling between "landscape" to "portrait" orientation â€“- width becomes height, height becomes width. 

Exactly the same as manually doing the following:

1. selecting an artboard
1. changing the value of the width to be the value of the height, and changing the height to be the value of the width


## How To Use

1. Select one or more artboards
1. Run the plugin

### Usage Notes
* The plugin will disregard selected items that are not artboards.
* If no elements are selected, the plugin will simply do nothing.
* There is basic logging (to the Sketch plugin console) for each artboard rotated.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
None Assigned.



### Known Issues

**Artboard Overlap**

Currently, an artboard might be rotated and end up overlapping another artboard on the document.

Solution is to manually move the overlapping artboard(s) so that they do not overlap.
